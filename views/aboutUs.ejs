        <p class="founderReasonText">From the instant Covid-19 stay-at-home orders began, Tannen, Bryce and Brianne began searching for a way to help the countless number of elementary age school children who were falling behind academically. They knew something had to be done, as families were struggling to cope with remote learning while working or not being familiar with the curriculum. </p>
        <p class="founderReasonText">In California, over 44% speak languages other than English at home, and in 61% of families both parents work full-time.  Without outside help, the majority of kids will fall behind due to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
        <p class="founderReasonText">We are committed to creating strength in our community with Tut-Tut.org - a non-profit organization that provides free tutoring for K-5th graders.  Tut-Tut.org is a website that connects elementary age children with qualified high school tutors that have volunteered their time to help kids stay caught up on their education during the Pandemic.</p>
